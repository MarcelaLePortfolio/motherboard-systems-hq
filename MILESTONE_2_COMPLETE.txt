âœ… MILESTONE 2 COMPLETE â€“ Shared Memory Reliability

All checklist items successfully implemented and verified:

1. ðŸ›  Cade reads/writes the agent_chain_state.json file without corruption.
2. ðŸ›  File-locking is implemented using proper-lockfile to prevent conflicts.
3. ðŸ›  State integrity is verified immediately after each write.
4. ðŸ›  State changes are logged for debugging and runtime visibility.

Confirmed via:
â€¢ test-cade-state.ts (read â†’ mutate â†’ write â†’ re-read)
â€¢ Runtime logs from Cade (pm2 logs cade)
â€¢ Manual inspection of memory/agent_chain_state.json

Next milestone: M3 â€“ UI Live Wiring
