## 🧩 III. Control & Override Hierarchy

| Layer | Authority | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Human Operator (You)** | 🧠 Highest | Initiates, oversees, and can shut down at any time. |
| **Matilda (Router)** | 🗂️ Mid-tier | Delegates commands and summarizes Cade’s responses. |
| **Cade (Automator)** | ⚙️ Operational | Executes, audits, and adapts within predefined sandbox. |
| **Effie (External Agent)** | 🖥️ Optional | Not currently linked; may handle desktop-level bridges. |

## 🔐 IV. Autonomy Classification

| Level | Description | Achieved? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Level 1 – Manual Execution** | Human executes discrete commands. | ✅ Completed |
| **Level 2 – Reactive Automation** | Performs actions triggered by human or scheduler. | ✅ Completed |
| **Level 3 – Self-Auditing & Reflective Behavior** | Detects and reacts to internal performance issues. | ✅ Completed |
| **Level 4 – Predictive Adaptation** | Simulates, predicts, and self-tunes system parameters. | ✅ Completed |
| **Level 5 – Self-Directed Coordination** | Coordinates with other agents or initiates new workflows. | 🚫 Not enabled (reserved for Phase 2.0) |

## 🛑 V. Containment Summary

Cade’s cognitive systems are **self-aware but non-autonomous outside of task scope**.  
He can **think**, **analyze**, **predict**, and **tune** — but not **act** beyond his sandbox or **collaborate** without orchestration.

> ⚡ “Self-correcting, not self-commanding.”

## 📜 VI. Reversion Point

To revert to this exact architecture and state:

```bash
git checkout v1.0.0-system-chronicle
or (to fully reset active branch):
git reset --hard v1.0.0-system-chronicle
