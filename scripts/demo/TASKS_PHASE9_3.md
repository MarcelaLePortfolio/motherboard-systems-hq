## 🎥 Phase 9.3 — Automated Demo Playback System

### Objective
Automate full demo playback to simulate live delegation, reflection flow, and agent synchronization.

### Tasks
1. Create `run-demo-playback.ts` to orchestrate cinematic replay of tasks and reflections.
2. Sequence reflection injections from JSON snapshot (`reflections.json`).
3. Synchronize Atlas banner and Agent Status Row animations.
4. Integrate optional slow-motion or skip controls.
5. Add `demo-reset-and-play.sh` for one-command demo startup.
6. Confirm <3s roundtrip timing consistency.
7. Tag completion as `v0.9.3-demo-playback-ready`.

### Expected Outcome
🎬 Seamless cinematic demo experience — agents delegating, reflections animating, Atlas banner syncing, and dashboard flowing autonomously.
