✅ Cade FileOps Verified – Sept 23, 2025

Tested operation:
  ➤ Command: 'write to file'
  ➤ Path: memory/test.txt
  ➤ Content: 'Hello Cade'
  ➤ Result: { status: 'success', message: 'File written to memory/test.txt' }

Safe path validation logic is now functioning correctly.

Next tests:
  • Read file (memory/test.txt)
  • Delete file (memory/test.txt)
  • PM2-based execution confirmation
  • Task routing from Matilda to Cade
  • Persistence test across agent restarts
