<0072matilda.k> [devlog:cade] âœ… Shared memory sync committed.
- New file: shared_registry.json (global agent memory)
- Sync includes:
  â–¸ retry/escalation record
  â–¸ override resolution + triage status
  â–¸ agent locks + last handler snapshot

- Locking logic added to prevent double-claim across agents.

ðŸ“Œ Module stable. Ready to begin UI mirroring or TTL expiry next.
