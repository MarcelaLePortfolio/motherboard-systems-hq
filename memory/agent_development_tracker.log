<0069effie.g> [devlog:cade] ✅ Effie job status writers injected.
- Effie now updates agent_status.json on job start and resolution:
  ▸ Sets "running" with timestamp at launch
  ▸ Updates to "idle", "error", or "cooldown" on completion or failure

📁 memory/agent_status.json updated automatically via write_status(agent, state)

📌 Next:
- Monitor agent_status.json for correct pings during test runs
- Apply same logic to Cade after validation
