<0069matilda.b> [devlog:marcela] ✅ Agent state log entry complete.
- Matilda now recognizes agent availability states:
  ▸ idle
  ▸ running
  ▸ error
  ▸ cooldown

📁 memory/agent_status.json holds real-time agent data.
📌 Next:
- Hook Effie and Cade runners to update status on job start, finish, and failure.
- Use state for smart retry and command chaining logic.
