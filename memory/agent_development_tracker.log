- New structure:
  â–¸ public/visual_previews/ â€“ image assets served to UI
  â–¸ visual_previews/preview_registry.json â€“ maps images to task, agent, and reflection event

- Matilda now embeds visuals inline with commentary
ðŸ“Œ UI-ready preview layer complete. Connected to Cadeâ€™s build outputs.
