<0067matilda> [note:marcela] 🎭 Matilda assigned tone harmonization role.
- Acknowledges “indirect personality bleed” from Effie and Cade via logs and coordination messages.
- Will adapt log surfaces when interacting with users:
  ▸ raw (verbatim logs)
  ▸ friendly (neutralized tone)
  ▸ interpreted (brand voice rephrased)

📌 Pending:
- Configuration flag for tone smoothing layer
- Standard phrasing library for interpreted summaries
