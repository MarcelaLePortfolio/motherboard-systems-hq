<0072matilda.c> [devlog:cade] ✅ Retry filtering logic outlined for Matilda.
- Eligibility conditions:
  ▸ attempts < max_attempts
  ▸ (timestamp now - last_attempt) > delay_window
  ▸ not sensitive unless override:true

🔁 Matilda will:
- Log skipped retries with reason
- Emit requeue signal for eligible entries
- Reset task metadata on retry attempt

📌 Requeue logic to be coded next.
