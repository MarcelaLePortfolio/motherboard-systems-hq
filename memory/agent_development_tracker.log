<0072matilda.d> [devlog:cade] 🛠️ Matilda retry dispatch logic queued.
- Requeue trigger fires only if:
  ▸ Not sensitive (or override:true)
  ▸ attempts < max_attempts
  ▸ retry window elapsed (or override:true)

✅ Action on valid retry:
- Structured requeue task emitted
- Retry registry updated
- Outcome logged per task

📌 Next: mock test to validate requeue + suppression logic
