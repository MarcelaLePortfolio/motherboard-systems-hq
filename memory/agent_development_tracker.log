<0070matilda.b> [devlog:marcela] Chaining logic initialized.
- Matilda now maintains a temporary chained_tasks.json file.
- Tasks listed here are auto-executed when the agent returns to "idle" without error.

📁 Structure:
- memory/chained_tasks.json = { agent: [commands...] }
- Tasks cleared once executed or if agent fails current task

📌 Next: connect chaining to structured command orchestration
