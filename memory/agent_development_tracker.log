<0069matilda.c> [devlog:marcela] ðŸ§  Agent ping hook integration next.
- Matilda state memory is now in sync and actively referenced during orchestration.
- Agent availability prevents command overlap, sets up for retry and chaining logic.

ðŸ“Œ Implementation next steps:
- Cade + Effie to send "status: running" on job start
- Update to "idle", "error", or "cooldown" on completion/failure
- Time-stamped agent_status.json writes

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Full lifecycle awareness across active agents
