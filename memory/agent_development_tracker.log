<0068effie.d> [devlog:cade] âœ… Effie fallback structure established.
- Commands failing primary execution now generate structured error payloads.
- All error payloads routed back to Matilda for logging, retry, or tone-filtered surfacing.
- Effie no longer halts on failure; returns control cleanly to orchestration layer.

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- Retry logic delegated to Matilda
- Effie now silent on user surface unless explicitly routed
