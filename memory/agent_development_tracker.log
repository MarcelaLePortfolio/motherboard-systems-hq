<0072matilda.ah> [devlog:cade] âœ… Live agent chaining scaffolded.
- Runtime logic includes:
  â–¸ agent_chain_state.json for active thread ownership
  â–¸ chaining_runtime_log.json for full delegation audit
  â–¸ resume_payload.json for task resumption at peer yield

ðŸ“Œ System now dynamically routes live queries to best-suited agent and supports mid-flow handoffs.
