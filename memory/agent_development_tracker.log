<0072matilda.ab> [devlog:cade] âœ… Cross-agent sync logic complete â€“ Matilda negotiates memory-aware coordination.
- Live sync protocol includes:
  â–¸ shared_registry.json: cross-agent state and escalation tracking
  â–¸ sync_trace.json: communication history for review
  â–¸ agent_sync_state.json: posture state and participation mode

ðŸ“Œ Matilda now avoids redundancy, honors handoffs, and suppresses loops in shared task space.
ðŸ“Œ Next upgrade: peer recommendation engine and active yielding behavior.
