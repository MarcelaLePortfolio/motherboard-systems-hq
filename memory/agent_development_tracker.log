<0069matilda.a> [devlog:marcela] 🧠 Agent state tracking scaffold initiated.
- Matilda will maintain awareness of Cade and Effie’s current status.
- Enables smarter orchestration: prevents command overlap, supports retry eligibility, unlocks chaining logic.

📁 New structure:
- memory/agent_status.json → real-time agent status (idle, running, error, cooldown, etc.)
- Agents will ping status on job start/end/error.

📌 Next:
- Add status ping logic to Effie + Cade runners
- Write initial memory file with boot states
