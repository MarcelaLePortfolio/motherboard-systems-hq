<0070effie.h> [devlog:cade] 🛡️ Effie resilience layer in progress.
- Effie will now re-emit command failure payloads as structured responses.
- Supports graceful job recovery, chained fallback suggestions, and session retention.

🧠 Key additions:
- Structured error: includes command context, error reason, timestamp
- Logged to memory/effie_runtime.log and returned to Matilda
- Supports Matilda decision-making: escalate, suppress, or retry

📌 Next:
- Test with mock failure trigger
- Add resilience flags for Matilda override (e.g. suppress future retries)
