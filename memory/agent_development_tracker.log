<0067effiecade> [note:marcela] ðŸŽ­ Indirect personality surface audit activated.
- Though Effie and Cade are not user-facing, their logs, fallback messages, and orchestration replies carry implicit tone.
- This introduces a new design vector: "indirect personality bleed."

ðŸ§  Implications:
- Logs, error messages, retry logic, and fallback phrasing should now be audited for tone.
- Decide per agent: neutral, lightly stylized, or distinctly voiced.
- Option: Matilda can translate raw logs into a unified tone when surfacing to user.

ðŸš§ To Do:
- Apply this principle during upcoming sophistication layering for Effie + Cade.
