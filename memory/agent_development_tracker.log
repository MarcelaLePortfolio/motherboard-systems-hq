<0070matilda.a> [devlog:marcela] Retry logic baseline added.
- Matilda now supports one-shot retry when an agent returns from "error" to "idle".
- Retries are pulled from a temp command cache if last state was failure.

📁 Future logic:
- Retry queue is distinct from chaining queue
- Retry is suppressed if failure marked resolved downstream
