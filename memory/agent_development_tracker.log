<0068effie.c> [devlog:cade] ✅ Effie runtime now gated by safeguards.
- Effie executes only commands targeting whitelisted directories.
- All output and errors are logged to memory/effie_runtime.log.
- Unsafe or unexpected commands are rejected with error: "⛔ Unauthorized execution context."

🛡️ Guardrails:
- Whitelisted: scripts/, memory/, utils/, logs/, package.json
- Rejected commands now return structured error to Matilda orchestration
