<0072matilda.g> [devlog:cade] âœ… Escalation tagging logic queued.
- Escalation tags:
  â–¸ soft_escalation â€“ silent elevation for complex failures
  â–¸ hard_escalation â€“ surfaced attention needed

- Trigger logic:
  â–¸ Max attempts hit with unchanging failure type
  â–¸ Repeated retry resets without progress
  â–¸ Cross-agent suppression threshold exceeded

ðŸ“Œ Next step: implement tag logic and escalation_registry writer
