<0072matilda.aa> [note:marcela] <0001fa1e> Agent sync protocol initialization begins.
- Next capability tier: cross-agent shared memory and sync negotiation
  â–¸ Matilda will listen for shared_registry updates from Cade or Effie
  â–¸ Will coordinate escalation prevention, task handoff, and loop suppression

- Components to be implemented:
  â–¸ shared_registry.json â€“ central handoff and escalation metadata
  â–¸ agent_sync_state.json â€“ records Matilda's current sync posture and state
  â–¸ sync_trace.json â€“ logs sync messages and decisions per episode

ðŸ“Œ This phase ensures Matilda is fully aware of and responsive to other agentsâ€™ activity.
