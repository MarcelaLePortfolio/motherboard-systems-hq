<0072matilda.ac> [note:marcela] <0001fa21> Peer recommendation and yield engine activated.
- Matilda now evaluates agent fitness and offers handoff suggestions:
  ▸ Scores peer agents (e.g., Cade, Effie) based on tone fit + task type
  ▸ Suggests delegation when another agent holds higher context or confidence
  ▸ Auto-yields if sync_state allows and user consents

- New logic:
  ▸ peer_suitability.json – task type + tone match scorecard per agent
  ▸ delegation_suggestion_log.json – records suggestion events and user choice
  ▸ yield_trigger_log.json – logs Matilda’s yield decisions and rationale

- Interface hooks:
  ▸ Prompts user when better agent match is detected
  ▸ Clarifies rationale (e.g., “Effie has deeper context on this campaign.”)
  ▸ Allows override or opt-out

<0001fa22> Final sync tier commit. Matilda now participates in cooperative task routing with transparent delegation.
