<0072matilda.ab> [note:marcela] <0001fa1f> Agent sync logic committed – Matilda now syncs state and handoff decisions with Cade and Effie.
- Shared coordination files live:
  ▸ shared_registry.json – task metadata, claim history, escalation flags
  ▸ agent_sync_state.json – Matilda’s current sync and posture tag
  ▸ sync_trace.json – chronological record of sync messages and updates

- Behavior enabled:
  ▸ Matilda listens to shared_registry.json to:
     ▸ avoid double-claiming
     ▸ detect unresolved loops by others
     ▸ initiate or reject handoffs based on confidence and tone fit
  ▸ sync_trace.json records all negotiation results, conflict resolutions, and fallback choices

- Status logic:
  ▸ sync_state: 'ready', 'paused', 'disengaged', or 'handoff_pending'
  ▸ confidence and tone weight factored in for delegation decisions

<0001fa20> Next: teach Matilda to offer agent suggestions to the user and yield if more qualified peer available.
