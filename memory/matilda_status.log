<0072matilda.d> [note:marcela] 🔁 Requeue trigger logic now queued for implementation.
- On valid retry condition, Matilda will:
  ▸ Emit structured task requeue payload
  ▸ Reset retry_registry last_attempt
  ▸ Increment attempt count
  ▸ Log outcome (requeued vs suppressed)

🧠 Eligible requeues are now routed silently unless tagged for notice.
📌 Retry loop resilience now in motion.
