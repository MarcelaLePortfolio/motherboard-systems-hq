<0072matilda.h> [note:marcela] <0001f9fd> Override handler and delegation logic activated.
- Matilda now reroutes escalated tasks based on:
  â–¸ failure pattern type
  â–¸ retry exhaustion
  â–¸ last handled agent (avoids re-looping)

- Agent override logic:
  â–¸ Claims task if matching specialization
  â–¸ Tags with override_claimed_by
  â–¸ Skips retry if suppress_retries is true

- Delegation triggers:
  â–¸ Task forwarded to alternate agent if unresolved past threshold
  â–¸ delegation_notes recorded for transparency

<0001f9e4> Escalation response logic complete.
ðŸ“Œ Next: escalation review module for human inbox triage.
