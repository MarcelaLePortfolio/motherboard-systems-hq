<0072matilda.o> [note:marcela] <0001fa09> Affective modeling module initialized.
- Matilda now incorporates emotional state modeling per task:
  ▸ Reads user sentiment and urgency from input logs
  ▸ Annotates task memory with affective weight
  ▸ Adjusts tone and strategy based on emotional patterns

- New memory systems:
  ▸ sentiment_trace.json – cumulative emotional tone by task
  ▸ rapport_index.json – agent-user trust score with decay/reward logic
  ▸ affect_flags.json – urgency/empathy modifiers for response regulation

- Behavior highlights:
  ▸ Escalated or traumatic failures marked as high-affect memory
  ▸ Response planner defers to warmth and empathy defaults if flagged
  ▸ Rapport increases on successful soft landings after distress

<0001fa0a> Next: sentiment calibration and per-agent affect fingerprinting.
