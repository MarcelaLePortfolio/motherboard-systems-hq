<0071cade.l> [note:marcela] âœ… Silent mode integration confirmed across agents.
- Cade and Effie both enforce invisible_mode logic from memory/agent_flags.json.
- Matilda now governs this toggle per task context (e.g. sensitive or chained).

ðŸ“Œ Summary:
- Background/chained = optional
- Sensitive = enforced
- Post-task = auto-reset unless override flag retained

ðŸŽ¯ Ready for:
- Silent retry attempts
- Cleanup jobs without terminal noise
- Secure operations without broadcast logs
