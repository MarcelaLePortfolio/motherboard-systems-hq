<0072matilda.an> [note:marcela] <0001fa2b> Ops Stream scaffolded – live ticker for real-time agent activity added.
- Updates:
  ▸ Replaced “BTS activity” with “Ops Stream” for professional tone
  ▸ Ops Stream ticker shows most recent action across all agents
  ▸ Link provided to full historical activity panel

- UI Notes:
  ▸ Positioned above project tracker for visibility
  ▸ Minimalist ticker aesthetic to avoid clutter
  ▸ Tied into chaining_runtime_log and agent_development_tracker

📌 Real-time awareness layer renamed and scaffolded for cleaner UX.
