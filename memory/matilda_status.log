<0072matilda.ad> [note:marcela] <0001fa23> Agent personalization logic scaffolded.
- Matilda now supports user preference for agent naming style:
  ▸ Defaults to role-based identifiers (e.g., "Strategic Assistant")
  ▸ Optional toggle for friendly nicknames ("Matilda", "Effie", "Cade")

- New memory file:
  ▸ user_preferences.json
    - show_agent_nicknames: false (default)
    - agent_aliases: maps internal names to optional nicknames

- Onboarding prompt:
  ▸ “Would you like me to introduce myself and the other agents by name? I can either stick with professional role titles, or we can use more personal nicknames.”

📌 Clears path for full settings panel and user-configurable environment.
