<0072matilda.ae> [note:marcela] <0001fa24> External I/O hook logic scaffolded.
- Matilda now supports structured import/export to external systems:
  â–¸ Exports include memory_trace, reflection_log, tone_strategy, etc.
  â–¸ Imports validated before being merged into active memory

- New files:
  â–¸ external/export_hooks.json â€“ export targets and trigger rules
  â–¸ external/import_queue.json â€“ incoming external payloads for review
  â–¸ external/io_trace_log.json â€“ history of all I/O operations

- Behavior:
  â–¸ Exports can target Notion, Airtable, JSON bundle, etc. (integration pending)
  â–¸ Imports paused for user confirmation or automated review
  â–¸ All actions logged for audit and recovery

ðŸ“Œ Ready for integration into dashboards or automation systems.
