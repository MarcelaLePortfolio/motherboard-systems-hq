<0070matilda.b> [note:marcela] âœ… Task chaining logic scaffolded.
- Matilda now supports follow-up command scheduling via chained_tasks.json.
- When agent completes a task and returns to "idle" without error, chained task is automatically dispatched.

ðŸ§  Behavior:
- Chained commands are queued at execution time, not stored permanently
- Chaining suppressed if agent enters "error" or "cooldown"
- Supports future expansion to multi-step flows

ðŸ“Œ Ready for:
- Writing initial chaining memory file
- Linking chained tasks to primary commands by session or job ID
