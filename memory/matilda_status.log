<0072matilda.aj> [note:marcela] <0001fa27> Visual toggle hidden by default â€“ now defaults to enabled.
- Updated onboarding logic:
  â–¸ enable_visual_previews defaults to true
  â–¸ Toggle exists in user_preferences.json but is not shown to most users
  â–¸ May be exposed later in enterprise or advanced UI settings

- Reasoning:
  â–¸ Visuals are local-only, with no outbound network activity
  â–¸ Previews enhance transparency, reduce ambiguity, and support teachable UX
  â–¸ No privacy risk or performance drag in normal use

ðŸ“Œ UX streamlined â€“ visual previews now always on unless explicitly disabled.
