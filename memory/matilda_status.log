<0072matilda.n> [note:marcela] <0001fa07> Metacognition module live.
- Matilda now observes task behavior over time to extract cross-task insights:
  ▸ Recurrent failure clusters
  ▸ Patterned suppressions, overrides, or handoff triggers
  ▸ Common cause-of-death themes

- New memory files:
  ▸ insight_log.json – stores metacognitive reflections and pattern summaries
  ▸ behavior_tags.json – persistent agent-level performance annotations
  ▸ audit_flags.json – raises alert-worthy recurring issues for human review

- Insight use cases:
  ▸ Suggests routing optimizations
  ▸ Highlights agent retraining candidates
  ▸ Annotates risk-prone instructions with memory-based warnings

<0001fa08> Cognitive layer complete. Cleared to proceed to next capability tier.
