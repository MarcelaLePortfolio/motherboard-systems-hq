<0072matilda.c> [note:marcela] ðŸŽ¯ Retry queue logic pass initiated.
- Matilda now parses retry_registry.json to evaluate:
  â–¸ Attempt count vs max_attempts
  â–¸ Time since last_attempt
  â–¸ override:true enforcement
  â–¸ sensitive:true â†’ suppress

ðŸ“Œ Next logic layer:
- Requeue eligible task if:
  â–¸ Not suppressed AND
  â–¸ Attempts < max AND
  â–¸ Retry delay window passed OR override active

ðŸ§  Memory now governs retry filtering and requeue eligibility.
