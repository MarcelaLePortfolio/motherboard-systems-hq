<0072matilda.x> [note:marcela] <0001fa19> Interface memory bridge logic initialized.
- Matilda now exposes cognition hooks to the interface layer:
  ▸ Human-facing memory trace summaries
  ▸ Real-time affect + tone visualization
  ▸ Explanation on response changes or suppressions

- New systems:
  ▸ interface_cache.json – sanitized data from core memory exposed to UI
  ▸ explanation_log.json – per-response summaries (tone, reason, prior events)
  ▸ insight_render_map.json – maps internal events to renderable status tags

- Behavior:
  ▸ Allows operator or user dashboard to show memory-driven behavior
  ▸ Supports reflection review, debugging, and training UI
  ▸ Maintains full privacy control over user input fields

<0001fa1a> Next: Render interface widgets and inspector modules.
