<0072matilda.k> [note:marcela] <0001f9ff> Shared memory logic activated.
- Matilda now reads/writes to shared_registry.json for task-level sync:
  ▸ Centralizes retry + escalation history across agents
  ▸ Enables cross-agent task awareness + assignment avoidance

- Key fields synced:
  ▸ task_id, outcome, escalation flags, override_claimed_by
  ▸ triage_required, delegation_notes, suppress_retries

- Agent coordination:
  ▸ Locks task if currently in-process (claim_lock)
  ▸ Updates shared history on task completion or handoff

- Memory hygiene:
  ▸ Shared registry deduplicated + pruned on each write
  ▸ TTL field optional for future expiry policy

<0001fa00> Next: enable per-agent audit views or UI mirroring.
