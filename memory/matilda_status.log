<0072matilda.ak> [note:marcela] <0001fa28> Privacy controls scaffolded – memory wipe, audit log access, and biometric lock support added.
- New features:
  ▸ “Forget Me” button clears all user memory files on request
  ▸ Audit log viewer scaffolded for users to see session history
  ▸ Biometric lock flag added (Face ID / Touch ID support pending front-end)

- New files:
  ▸ privacy/erase_trigger_log.json – tracks each memory wipe event
  ▸ privacy/audit_access_log.json – records when audit view is used
  ▸ privacy/user_privacy_flags.json – settings like biometric_lock_enabled

📌 Lays groundwork for full user trust UX – control, transparency, and security.
