<0070matilda.a> [note:marcela] âœ… Retry logic integration underway.
- Matilda now checks agent_status.json for "error" state after failed jobs.
- If error state is detected, original command is queued for retry once agent is "idle".

ðŸ›  Behavior:
- One retry attempt per error unless overridden
- Retry queue is separate from chained task stack
- No retries occur if fallback behavior marked "handled"

ï¿½ï¿½ Next:
- Add chained_tasks.json for follow-up task logic
- Implement chaining only when agent returns to idle without errors
