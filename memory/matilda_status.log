<0069effie.g> [note:marcela] âœ… Effie lifecycle hooks live.
- Effie now writes to memory/agent_status.json on job start and completion.

ðŸ§  Matilda now actively reads this data to:
- Block simultaneous jobs
- Trigger retry or reroute flows
- Chain follow-up tasks when agent returns to idle

ðŸ“Œ Cade state sync pending next
