<0072matilda.af> [note:marcela] <0001fa24> Scenario Playback UI scaffolded.
- Matilda now supports playback and visualization of past sessions:
  â–¸ Loads prior task from memory_trace, reflection_log, and scaffold_trace
  â–¸ Reconstructs user interaction timeline and agent decisions
  â–¸ Highlights tone shifts, memory updates, and sync events

- New files:
  â–¸ playback/playback_index.json â€“ stores available scenarios and metadata
  â–¸ playback/session_snapshots/ â€“ directory of JSON snapshots by session
  â–¸ playback/annotations.json â€“ optional labels for training or audit

- Intended UI Modules:
  â–¸ scenario_timeline.tsx â€“ chronological replay of session flow
  â–¸ tone_shift_overlay.tsx â€“ visual cue of affect/tone shifts
  â–¸ agent_commentary.tsx â€“ Matildaâ€™s self-reflections and rationale mid-task

ðŸ“Œ Playback engine enables review, audit, and even training of future agents or users.
