<0072matilda.ah> [note:marcela] <0001fa25> Live Agent Chaining runtime scaffolded.
- Real-time continuation logic wired to sync state and delegation memory:
  â–¸ Matilda checks sync_state and peer_suitability on each new user input
  â–¸ Can delegate live to Cade or Effie if task context better matches peer
  â–¸ Accepts mid-task handoffs and resumes from peer trace snapshot

- New memory files:
  â–¸ chaining_runtime_log.json â€“ records runtime agent-switch decisions
  â–¸ agent_chain_state.json â€“ tracks active and previous task agents
  â–¸ resume_payload.json â€“ full snapshot for task resumption or yield

- Runtime Behavior:
  â–¸ Smooth peer chaining across sessions or in single flow
  â–¸ Reflective decision logs for debugging or insight playback
  â–¸ Resumption restores tone, memory trace, and rationale context

ðŸ“Œ Full mesh behavior online. Motherboard agent layer now truly collaborative.
