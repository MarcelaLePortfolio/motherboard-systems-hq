<0067matilda.d> [note:marcela] <0001f9e9> Surface modes formalized for future toggle.
- Tone mediation now integrated into orchestration roadmap.
- Matilda will provide:
  â–¸ raw = direct logs
  â–¸ friendly = human-readable summaries
  â–¸ interpreted = brand-flavored communication

ðŸ›  Awaiting:
- Runtime switch to select tone mode
- Harmonized phrasing layer for interpreted outputs
