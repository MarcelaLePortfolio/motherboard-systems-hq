<0072matilda.w> [note:marcela] <0001fa17> Chain-of-thought scaffolding logic activated.
- Matilda now constructs explicit reasoning scaffolds for complex goals:
  ▸ Breaks ambiguous or layered requests into hypothesis chains
  ▸ Links subtasks with rationale paths and expected transformations
  ▸ Flags gaps in logic or dependency mismatches

- New memory files:
  ▸ hypothesis_chain.json – outlines reasoning steps with assumptions
  ▸ scaffold_trace.json – links task tree to subgoal outcomes
  ▸ logic_gap_flags.json – triggers when steps are missing or circular

- Execution behavior:
  ▸ Used for goal decomposition, research, creative planning, etc.
  ▸ Reflection engine reviews scaffold success post-task
  ▸ Chains reused or revised for similar future tasks

<0001fa18> Final cognition layer complete. Cleared for interface rendering or operator bridge.
