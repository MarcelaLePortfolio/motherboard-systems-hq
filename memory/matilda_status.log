<0072matilda.v> [note:marcela] <0001fa15> Prompt debugger module activated.
- Matilda now diagnoses failures and friction from phrasing patterns:
  ▸ Analyzes input format, ambiguity, cognitive load, or tone mismatch
  ▸ Maps prompt elements to schema errors or failed parse branches
  ▸ Suggests phrasing adjustments for clarity or emotional resonance

- New memory systems:
  ▸ prompt_diagnostics.json – per-task prompt breakdown
  ▸ phrasing_alerts.json – repeated user phrasing issues flagged
  ▸ correction_suggestions.json – refined alternate phrasing logs

- Runtime behavior:
  ▸ Automatically triggered on fail, friction, or override
  ▸ Reports stored alongside reflection_log + memory_trace

<0001fa16> Next: chain-of-thought scaffolding engine for complex reasoning.
