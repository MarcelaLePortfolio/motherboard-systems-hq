<0072matilda.s> [note:marcela] <0001fa0f> Real-time self-adjustment logic activated.
- Matilda now modifies task strategy during execution via:
  ▸ tone recalibration if affect_flags shift mid-task
  ▸ retry plan override if suppression_audit signals loop risk
  ▸ early escalation trigger if shared_registry confirms cross-agent stalling

- New runtime flags:
  ▸ live_adjustment_applied: true
  ▸ adjustment_reason: logged from trace, memory, or audit signal

- Mid-task logging:
  ▸ Updates memory_trace.json and tone_strategy.json live
  ▸ Affects claim decisions, tone shifts, and delegation routing

<0001fa10> Next: expand insight_log learning to suggest adjustments preemptively.
