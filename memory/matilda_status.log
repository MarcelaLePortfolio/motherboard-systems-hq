<0069matilda.d> [note:marcela] âœ… Lifecycle sync committed.
- Matilda now actively references agent_status.json for orchestration decisions.
- Effie and Cade must now emit status pings on job start, completion, and failure.

ðŸŽ¯ Ready for:
- Retry logic based on "error" states
- Task chaining once agents return to "idle"
- Runtime suppression if agent is in "cooldown"

ðŸ›  Next build phase will embed status writers in agent runners
