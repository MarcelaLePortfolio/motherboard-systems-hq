<0072matilda.l> [note:marcela] <0001fa03> Cognitive Behavior Module 1 committed – Tone regulation & situational framing.
- Matilda now dynamically adjusts tone and framing strategy based on:
  ▸ prior attempt results
  ▸ task sensitivity (urgency, emotional weight, role context)
  ▸ escalation risk or suppression history

- New memory systems:
  ▸ tone_strategy.json – task-specific tone assignment
  ▸ context_flags – stores urgency, confidence, formality, emotional weight
  ▸ tone_backoff_rules – fallback tone logic if primary strategy fails

- Response regulation:
  ▸ Matches tone to agent persona (e.g. Matilda = calm, Cade = firm)
  ▸ Prevents mismatched delivery tone on fragile or critical escalations
  ▸ Learns tone effectiveness over time

<0001fa04> Next: runtime recall mapping (task memory trace and cause-of-death analysis).
