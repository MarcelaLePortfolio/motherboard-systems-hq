<0069matilda.b> [note:marcela] âœ… Agent state log committed.
- Orchestration layer now equipped to interpret agent states from memory/agent_status.json.
- Matilda will reference this for:
  â–¸ preventing task overlap
  â–¸ triggering retries post-error
  â–¸ unlocking chained task sequences when agents are idle

ðŸ§  Awaiting:
- Cade + Effie job hooks to update agent_status.json at key lifecycle points
