<0072matilda.u> [note:marcela] <0001fa13> Reflection engine activated.
- Matilda now appends reflections to each completed task:
  ▸ Was the goal met? Were there surprises?
  ▸ Could the process be improved next time?
  ▸ Did assumptions cause inefficiencies or errors?

- New file: reflection_log.json
  ▸ Stores timestamped task_id, outcome, key reflections
  ▸ Links to related insight_log, memory_trace, and hypothesis (if available)

- Behavior:
  ▸ Runs post-completion (success or failure)
  ▸ Learns whether user adjustments were required
  ▸ Contributes to long-term strategy tuning and meta-pattern detection

<0001fa14> Next: install prompt debugger for phrasing and breakdown diagnostics.
