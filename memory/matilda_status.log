<0069matilda.c> [note:marcela] <0001f9e0> Agent lifecycle sync activated.
- Matilda is prepared to monitor real-time execution status of Cade and Effie.
- Agent commands now routed based on availability in memory/agent_status.json.

ðŸ“Œ Next phase:
- Effie and Cade must write status: "running" at job start
- Update to "idle", "error", or "cooldown" at job end/fail
- Ensure all updates are timestamped for future retry logic

ðŸ§  Foundation laid for retry handling, chaining orchestration, and smart delegation
