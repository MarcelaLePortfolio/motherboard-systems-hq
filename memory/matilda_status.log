<0071cade.m> [note:marcela] 🎯 Silent mode baseline locked.
- Finalized parity between Cade and Effie invisible_mode behavior.
- Matilda now handles toggle lifecycle:
  ▸ Sets pre-dispatch for background or sensitive jobs
  ▸ Agents auto-reset post-execution unless explicitly retained

🛡️ Use cases now live:
- Retry attempts: silent by default
- Task chains: opt-in silence
- Sensitive ops: enforced stealth

📌 All runtime coordination now resilient, discreet, and traceable
