<0072matilda.t> [note:marcela] <0001fa11> Preemptive adjustment logic activated.
- Matilda now scans metacognitive memory before execution to refine task plan:
  ▸ Pulls patterns from insight_log.json and behavior_tags.json
  ▸ Warns user or adjusts tone/strategy if high-risk conditions detected
  ▸ Suggests delegation, escalation suppression, or tone softening in advance

- New behaviors:
  ▸ preflight_adjustments.json – stores pre-task refinements with rationale
  ▸ task_planner consults command_map.json + insight_log before plan lock
  ▸ audit_flags trigger override requests if prior risk tags match

- Effect:
  ▸ Reduces likelihood of repeated failure patterns
  ▸ Adds guardrails for fragile or ethically risky goals
  ▸ Improves learning loop from past task outcomes

<0001fa12> Command intelligence tier complete. Cleared to begin external interface linking or dashboard rendering.
