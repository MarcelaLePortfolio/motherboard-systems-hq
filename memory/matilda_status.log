<0069cade.f> [note:marcela] <0001f7e1> Cade lifecycle sync queued.
- Cade will now mirror Effieâ€™s integration: updating memory/agent_status.json in real time.
- Will log:
  â–¸ "running" at job start
  â–¸ "idle", "error", or "cooldown" at completion/failure

ðŸŽ¯ Matilda orchestration now expects parallel agent awareness across both runners.
ðŸ“Œ Awaiting Cade hook injection
