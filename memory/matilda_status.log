<0072matilda.m> [note:marcela] <0001fa05> Runtime recall and task memory trace logic committed.
- Matilda now maintains a rolling task memory trace:
  ▸ Includes final outcome, path taken, and all intervention flags
  ▸ Tracks retries, escalations, overrides, and human triage events

- Diagnostic features:
  ▸ cause_of_death.json – stores final failure summary if task abandoned
  ▸ memory_trace.json – step-by-step lifecycle trace for each task
  ▸ attempt_snapshots – last N attempts preserved (rotating buffer)

- Supports:
  ▸ Loop analysis and pattern detection
  ▸ Training data for self-improvement (future module)
  ▸ Transparency for human audit or assistant debugging

<0001fa06> Next: metacognition layer (cross-task insights and behavioral reflection).
