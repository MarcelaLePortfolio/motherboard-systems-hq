<0072matilda.q> [note:marcela] <0001fa0d> Command schema evolution logic initialized.
- Matilda now interprets and evolves incoming commands via:
  ▸ task_type recognition (creative, support, deployment, triage, etc.)
  ▸ command_map.json pattern routing and overrides
  ▸ schema-aware task tree generation

- New memory systems:
  ▸ command_map.json – links goal phrases to handling logic
  ▸ schema_versions.json – stores formatting changes over time
  ▸ task_tree_cache.json – stores multi-step interpretations of past goals

- Behavior features:
  ▸ Automatically refines vague input into structured subtasks
  ▸ Flags unknown or deprecated command styles for review
  ▸ Supports fallback path suggestion if goal is unsupported

<0001fa0e> Next: integrate real-time command feedback loop and adaptive refinement logic.
