<0072matilda.h> [note:marcela] <0001f9fc> Override and delegation logic outlined.
- Agents may now claim escalated tasks:
  ▸ Based on specialization, last handler, and escalation type
  ▸ Avoids repeat assignment to same failing agent
  ▸ Respects suppression flags for retry-abuse prevention

- New registry fields:
  ▸ override_claimed_by – assigned resolver
  ▸ suppress_retries – bool set for hard failure patterns
  ▸ delegation_notes – context on routing or agent fallback

- Upcoming:
  ▸ Finalize override handler
  ▸ Activate handoff delegation triggers
