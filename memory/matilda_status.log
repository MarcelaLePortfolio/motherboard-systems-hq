<0069effie.f> [note:marcela] <0001f7e1> Effie status pings queued for lifecycle sync.
- Effie will begin updating agent_status.json during execution:
  â–¸ "running" at start
  â–¸ "idle", "error", or "cooldown" at completion

ðŸ§  Matilda will interpret these in real time to:
- Suppress commands if busy
- Retry intelligently if errored
- Chain tasks once idle

ðŸ“Œ Cade hooks pending; Effie baseline comes first
