<0072matilda.g> [note:marcela] <0001f9fa> Escalation tagging logic outlined.
- Matilda will flag entries in retry_registry.json if:
  ▸ Max attempts are exhausted AND issue pattern matches known persistent errors
  ▸ Task remains unresolved across consecutive sweeps
  ▸ Retry interval is frequently reset without resolution (loop suspicion)

- Flags applied:
  ▸ ⚠️ soft_escalation – for silent review or agent retry override
  ▸ 🔥 hard_escalation – triggers surfaced alert or cross-agent attention

- Logging:
  ▸ Escalated items are copied to escalation_registry.json
  ▸ Status summaries are appended to hygiene log reports

📌 Supports:
- Stuck task identification
- Agent handoff logic
- Retry abuse detection

<0001f9e2> Next: implement tag conditions and escalation_registry writing
