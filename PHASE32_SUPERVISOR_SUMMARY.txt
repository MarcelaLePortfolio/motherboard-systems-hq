Phase 32 — Minimal Retry/Backoff Semantics (SQL-first)
Golden baseline:
- v31.9-golden-worker-image-fixed-ok

Objective:
- Minimal retry/backoff semantics: attempt limits + exponential backoff curve + terminal failure
- Verify no double-claim/completion under failure
- Keep surface area small & testable; SQL-level guarantees; single-writer safe

What’s implemented (small + deterministic):
1) DB schema (drizzle/0002_phase32_retry_backoff_minimal.sql)
- tasks.attempts (default 0)
- tasks.max_attempts (default 5)
- tasks.next_run_at (timestamptz)
- tasks.last_error, tasks.last_error_at
- index (status, next_run_at, id)

2) SQL-level guarantees (authoritative)
- phase32_claim_one.sql: claims only queued + eligible by next_run_at; FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED prevents double-claim
- phase32_mark_failure.sql: guarded from running; attempts++ ; queued+next_run_at w/ capped exponential backoff; terminal failed at max_attempts
- phase32_mark_success.sql: guarded from running -> completed

3) Worker wiring (minimal)
- phase26_task_worker.mjs prefers PHASE32_* SQL paths (fallback to PHASE27_*).
- Added a tiny deterministic failure hook for Phase 32 verification only:
  - meta.force_fail: true => always fail
  - meta.fail_n_times: N => fail while attempts < N
- Emits task.running, then task.retry_scheduled / task.failed, or task.completed.

Verification intent:
- Run 2+ workers concurrently: no task should be claimed twice (SKIP LOCKED)
- Retry respects next_run_at (no early claim)
- Attempts increments deterministically; terminal failure at max_attempts
