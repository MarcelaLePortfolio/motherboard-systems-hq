# Phase 39 Archive Note

This phase established the structural value-alignment foundation for Motherboard Systems HQ.

It introduced:

- Deterministic policy evaluation
- Explicit tier authority model
- Scoped + expiring override grants (Option A)
- Pure policy/grant combinator
- Stable audit record format
- Determinism regression guarantees
- Golden tag protocol
- Lock confirmation gate before wiring

No runtime behavior was altered.
No schema was changed.
No enforcement was enabled.

This phase is architectural groundwork.

Future phases must respect:
- Determinism invariants
- Authority separation
- Golden tag discipline
- Shadow-mode first enforcement strategy

Do not retroactively mutate this baseline.
