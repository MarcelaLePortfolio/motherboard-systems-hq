ðŸš€ MILESTONE 3 â€“ Backend Automation Skills (Phase 1 Complete)

âœ… Cade can autonomously execute delegated backend tasks via shared state.

Verified capabilities:
â€¢ Reads tasks from agent_chain_state.json
â€¢ Handles type: "install" and runs `pnpm add`
â€¢ Uses file-locking to avoid conflicts
â€¢ Updates state with "Completed" status and result log
â€¢ Logs execution to PM2 and state file

ðŸ”— Integration-ready:
This state format is fully compatible with upcoming:
â€¢ Ops Stream ticker (reads from agent_chain_state.json)
â€¢ Matilda assistant output hooks
â€¢ Project Tracker UI updates

No additional changes needed in Cade to support these features.

Next phase: add support for "commit", "pm2-restart", "build-ui"
