# Phase 11 – ZERO MORE DOCS. EXECUTE NOW.

This file exists ONLY to freeze the state and stop further planning.

Everything needed is already done:

- Stubbed endpoints live in server.mjs
- All helper scripts exist
- All rebuild instructions exist
- All curl test scripts exist
- All reminder files exist
- Repo is clean
- Container is ready to rebuild

There is NOTHING LEFT TO WRITE.

## ▶️ The ONLY next step now:

scripts/phase11_rebuild_dashboard_container.sh

Then:

scripts/phase11_delegate_task_curl.sh

Then (using returned id):

scripts/phase11_complete_task_curl.sh <TASK_ID>

---

No more commits.  
No more planning.  
Only runtime execution.
