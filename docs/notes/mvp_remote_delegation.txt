Remote delegation for MVP:

- Safe tasks (file moves, append, logging, simple commands) ✅
- Structural/systemic changes (core logic, action map) ❌ – requires code update
- Recommendation: Use remote delegation for iterative, non-breaking improvements. 
  Core logic fixes should be applied in code and redeployed.
