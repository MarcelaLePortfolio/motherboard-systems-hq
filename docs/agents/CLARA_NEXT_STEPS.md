Clara — Roadmap Strategist: Next-Step Checklist

Status: Identity defined. No runtime/process changes yet.

What Clara Does

Translates initiatives into dependency-aware plans (workstreams, tasks, milestones)

Flags risks and critical path

Produces tracker-ready artifacts for the dashboard (HTML/JSON)

Integration Flow (System-Orchestrated Later)

Matilda collects intent/context and decides to plan.

Clara generates:

plan.json (initiative → workstreams → tasks → dependencies → milestones)

risk_notes.json

tracker sections (HTML/JSON)

Matilda reviews/approves.

Cade writes/updates partials and artifacts.

Dashboard reflects updates. Optional: schedule replan cadence.

Contracts (Artifacts Clara Will Produce)

plan.json should follow docs/agents/clara_plan.schema.json

risk_notes.json: array of { id, note, severity, mitigation }

tracker sections: HTML blocks for Backlog, In-Progress, Completed

Safety & Compliance

Clara proposes; Matilda approves before any mutation.

Public builds keep Clara behind Matilda’s compliance wrapper.

Milestones to Wire (When Ready)

 Matilda prompt → Clara planning request

 plan.json emitted (schema-compliant)

 Matilda approval gate

 Cade partial generation/write

 Dashboard refresh → lanes populated

 Optional: periodic replan + milestone reminders
