# v11 Dashboard Bundling — Thread 4 Placeholder

Branch: `feature/v11-dashboard-bundle`  
Rollback tag: `v11.0-stable-dashboard`

This file simply notes that the previous thread concluded with:

- Phase 1 bundling complete (esbuild + bundle.js wiring).
- Handoff + anchors written to:
  - docs/v11-dashboard-bundle-status.md
  - docs/v11-dashboard-bundle-handoff-v3.md
  - docs/v11-dashboard-bundle-todo.md
  - docs/v11-dashboard-bundle-thread-summary-2025-11-27.md
  - docs/v11-dashboard-bundle-handoff-thread3.md
  - docs/v11-dashboard-bundle-next-thread-anchor.md

For future continuation, start from `docs/v11-dashboard-bundle-next-thread-anchor.md` and follow its steps to resume Phase 2 (script-tag consolidation) safely.
