# Matilda Chat – Option 1 Visual Result Note

User observation: “It looks unchanged to me.”

### Why this is expected

The recent Option 1 commits were **documentation-only**.  
They did **not** apply any structural layout changes.

Option 1’s purpose was:

- Restore the layout to a **stable known-good baseline**.
- Document that baseline in:
  - `docs/MATILDA_CHAT_LAYOUT_STATUS.md`
  - `docs/MATILDA_CHAT_OPTION1_TOP_ROW_ALIGNMENT.md`
- Avoid altering the main dashboard grid until Options 2–4.

### Therefore:
- The dashboard **should look exactly the same** after Option 1.
- The next visible UI adjustments will happen during:

2. **Column breathing room**  
3. **Responsive behavior**  
4. **Subtle animations**

This note logs why no visible change occurred.
