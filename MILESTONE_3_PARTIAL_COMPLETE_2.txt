ðŸš€ MILESTONE 3 â€“ Backend Automation Skills (Phase 2 Complete)

âœ… Cade can now autonomously:
1. Install or update dependencies via `pnpm add <package>` or `pnpm install`.
2. Modify & commit code changes via `git add . && git commit -m "<message>" && git push`.

Both operations:
â€¢ Are delegated via `agent_chain_state.json`
â€¢ Use file-locking for safe state updates
â€¢ Log results to both PM2 console and the shared state file

ðŸ”— Integration-ready:
This state format and result logging will drive future:
â€¢ Ops Stream ticker events
â€¢ Matildaâ€™s status announcements
â€¢ Project Tracker task updates

Remaining for full Milestone 3:
â€¢ Task type: "build-ui" â€“ Run build processes for dashboard UI
â€¢ Task type: "pm2-restart"/"pm2-stop"/"pm2-start" â€“ Service management

Switch condition: Once all four task types are implemented, Cade will be able to handle UI wiring work from start to finish without direct terminal input.
