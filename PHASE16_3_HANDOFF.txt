Start from tag: v16.3-merged-ui-cleanup-ok
Status:
- Single production-safe SSE indicator (footer)
- All debug/HUD/toasts gated behind window.__UI_DEBUG
- Dashboard footer clean (no empty script tags)
- Post-merge verify script added and whitelisted
Next recommended work:
- Phase 16.4: SSE reliability polish (heartbeat semantics, reconnect/backoff, stale-state detection)
- OR branch to Phase 17
