# Phase 39 — Terminal Stop

No additional documentation or scaffolding is required.

All architectural groundwork is complete.
All guardrails are in place.
All invariants are preserved.

Next movement is strictly:

1) Merge PRs
2) Run:
   scripts/phase39_main_verify_and_tag.sh
3) Confirm golden tag
4) Pause

Do not add more Phase 39 artifacts.
Do not expand scope.
Do not begin Phase 40 until tag exists.

Phase 39 is terminally complete pending merge + tag.
