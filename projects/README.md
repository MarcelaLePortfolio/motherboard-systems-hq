# Projects (Registry)

Purpose: a lightweight, future-proof place to define projects *without* committing to
containerization or specific project types yet.

Rule of thumb:
- dev mode = local process / quick iteration
- integrity mode = containerized (reproducible + rollback-friendly)

This folder is intentionally minimal until a project "graduates" (demo/share/exposed/dependency).
