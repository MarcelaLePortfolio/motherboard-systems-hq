Phase 11 v11.10 – Post-OPS SSE Removal Check

Current expectation:

OPS pill: visible, static "OPS: Unknown" (no SSE).

No EventSource or MIME-type errors in DevTools console.

Matilda chat + task delegation wired through dashboard-bundle-entry.js.

Manual check:

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard

Confirm:

OPS pill shows "OPS: Unknown" and there are no SSE-related errors.

Matilda chat:

Typing + submit shows "Matilda is thinking…"

Then shows reply or JSON in the Project Visual Output area.

Task delegation:

Shows "Delegating: …" then "Delegated ✓ (id: …, status: …)" in the log.

May mirror JSON into the Project Visual Output area.

If anything differs, capture:

A screenshot of the dashboard

The full DevTools console output

Then describe both in the next ChatGPT message for targeted fixes.
