# Phase 39 — State Sealed

Phase 39 implementation + documentation is complete.

Branches contain:
- Planning (authority model)
- Deterministic evaluator
- JSON policy
- Stable canonicalization
- Option A scoped grants
- Pure combine logic
- Structured audit record
- Test coverage
- Harnesses
- Golden tag plan
- Merge helper
- Lock confirmation gate
- Phase 40 shadow-mode preview
- Archive note

System remains:
- Deterministic
- Non-mutating
- Reviewable
- Reversible
- Golden-tag ready

Next action (manual, intentional):
Merge PRs → run:
  scripts/phase39_main_verify_and_tag.sh

Do not proceed beyond that until tag is confirmed.

Phase 39 is sealed pending merge + golden tag.
