This system describes a fully-local AI agent framework designed to operate without cloud dependencies. It includes:

- A Compiler Agent that transforms natural language instructions into executable step plans
- A Priority Execution Agent (e.g., STRYXX-1) that ranks and executes structured steps
- A Memory Engine using SQLite to persist state, logs, and recall context
- Cloudflare tunnels enabling mobile/remote access to local agents without external hosting

The system is modular, private, and built for redistribution without external dependencies.
