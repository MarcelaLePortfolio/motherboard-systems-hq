# Phase 37.6 — Next (Planning Stub)

## Current Baseline
- Golden: v37.5-run-view-terminal-kind-normalization-golden @ fbe7047d
- Postcheck: v37.5-postcheck @ 34011e4d
- Main HEAD: 943dba40
- CI required check present: ci/build-and-test workflow

## Goal (TBD)
Define the next smallest, scope-locked improvement following Phase 37.5 without touching schema/worker unless explicitly declared.

## Constraints
- PR-only changes (no direct pushes to main)
- One hypothesis per PR
- If 3 consecutive CI failures per hypothesis: stop and revert to last known good

## Status
📝 Planning stub only — no code changes yet.
