Start from tag v25.0-task-events-single-writer-ok; on feature/phase26-task-worker-min we added server/worker/phase26_task_worker.mjs + scripts/phase26_run_worker.sh; worker claims tasks where tasks.status='queued' via FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, sets running/completed(or failed), inserts task_events (kind + JSON payload-as-text) so /events/task-events streams task.created + task.running + task.completed/failed; smoke verified end-to-end with task t86 (events 261–263) and tasks.id=86 completed.
