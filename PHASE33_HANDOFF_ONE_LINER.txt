We are on feature/phase26-task-worker-min (pushed). Phase33 fixed docker workers claiming delegated tasks: phase32_claim_one.sql now claims WHERE status IN ('queued','delegated') ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED; docker-compose.worker.phase32.yml bind-mounts ./server/worker:/app/server/worker:ro for workerA+workerB; phase26_task_worker.mjs emits task_id as (row.task_id || String(row.id)) to keep stable string ids in task_events. Verified: sha256 parity host==workerA==workerB; 20 delegated → completed with clean task.created→task.running→task.completed, no duplicate terminal events, no numeric task_id drift. Commits in lane include 4bede779, 9543798b, ec70766e, plus 9c6c4251 adding PHASE33_SUPERVISOR_SUMMARY.md.
