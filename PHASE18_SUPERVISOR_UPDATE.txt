Phase 18 is complete and checkpointed (tag: v18.1-orchestration-phase18-complete). We added a PHASE18_ENABLE_ORCHESTRATION=1–gated, in-memory orchestration runtime: a minimal store + queue and a periodic tick loop wired into server.mjs via dynamic import, with optional cadence logging controls (PHASE18_TICK_MS / PHASE18_TICK_LOG_EVERY). Verified locally that the runtime starts cleanly and ticks. Next up (Phase 19) is to expose orchestrator state via a small gated JSON endpoint (/orchestrator/state) and optionally stream that state to the dashboard via SSE.
