# Phase 11 – STOP WRITING & EXECUTE

You have:
- All planning files
- All checklists
- All helper scripts
- All status snapshots
- A clean repo
- A healthy container
- The exact next step recorded repeatedly

No more documentation or commits are needed before execution.

---

## ✅ The only next thing to do is:

scripts/phase11_delegate_task_curl.sh

Run it once.
Capture the output.
Capture logs.

Then proceed exactly as written in the previous files:
- If response is good → run the complete-task script.
- If response is bad → start a new thread with output + logs.

---

## Reminder

Do NOT create new planning files before executing this command.
