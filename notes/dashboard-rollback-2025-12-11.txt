Dashboard rollback – 2025-12-11

Switched working copy to a new branch based on the last known stable
dashboard tag:

v11.7-ops-pill-dashboard-stable

Branch:

emergency/dashboard-rollback-v11.7

This branch is intended to restore a fully working dashboard baseline so
that Matilda backend routing and future changes can proceed from a clean,
stable state without the recent Express 5 and container routing issues.
